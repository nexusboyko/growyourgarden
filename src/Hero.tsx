          <code>Flowers</code> need to be watered <strong>every day</strong>. Each individual
          flower takes three days to growâ€”but make
          sure to water it every day until does! {' '}
          <strong>Don't worry!</strong> You won't lose your flowers if you miss a day, but
          you'll have to wait all over again for the last one to grow!

          <code>Trees</code> are a little different. They grow slowly, with each branch
          representing a smaller part of the goalâ€”and each leaf its
          completion. If the branches never grow, the tree will wither to a
          stump. If the parts are never completed, the tree will remain bare.{' '}
          <strong>Don't forget!</strong> You choose how big your goal is. The more branches a
          tree has, the longer it will take to grow; the fewer, the quicker!
